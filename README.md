        JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const, but they differ in scope, hoisting behaviour, and re-assignment rules.

        var: Declares variables with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope.
        let: Declares variables with block scope, allowing updates but not re-declaration within the same block.
        const: Declares block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
